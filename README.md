# MongoDB support for Integreat

Transporter that lets
[Integreat](https://github.com/integreat-io/integreat) use a MongoDB database
as service.

## Getting started

### Prerequisits

Requires at least node v12.9, Integreat v0.8, and MongoDb 3.6.

### Installing and using

Install from npm:

```
npm install integreat-transporter-mongodb
```

Example of use:

```javascript
import Integreat from 'integreat'
import mongodb from 'integreat-transporter-mongodb'
import defs from './config'

const resources = Integreat.mergeResources(Integreat.resources(), {
  transporters: { mongodb },
})
const great = Integreat.create(defs, resources)

// ... and then dispatch actions as usual
```

The data returns from `GET` actions will be the retrieved documents, while for
`SET` and `DELETE` actions the data will be result stats in the form of
`{ modifiedCount: 1, insertedCount: 2, deletedCount: 0 }`.

After including the `mongodb` transporter in your resources object, you still
need to configure your service to use it.

Example service configuration:

```javascript
{
  id: 'store',
  transporter: 'mongodb',
  auth: true,
  options: {
    uri: 'mongodb://username:password@mymongo.com',
  }
  endpoints: [
    { options: { db: 'store', collection: 'documents' } }
  ]
}
```

The `uri` is used as the uri to the database.

An endpoint may have a `query` property, which should be an array of path
objects describing the query object used with MongoDB's `find()` method.

Here's an example:

```javascript
{
  ...
  endpoints: [
    {
      id: 'getDrafts',
      options: {
        db: 'store',
        collection: 'documents',
        query: [
          { path: 'type', param: 'type' },
          { path: 'meta.status', value: 'draft' }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `path` property describes what property to set, and the property is set to
the value of `value` or to the value of the request parameter in `param`. You
also include `$`-prefixed mongo operators in `path`, and it will be handled
correctly.

The query object will look like this, for a request for items of type `entry`:

```javascript
{
  $type: 'entry',
  meta: { status: 'draft' }
}
```

When the `pageSize` param is set in a request, it is taken as the max number of
documents to return in the response. When nothing else is specified, the first
page of documents is returned, and the `paging.next` prop on the response will
hold a params object that may be used to get the next page.

**Note 1:** This transporter is currently updating and deleting arrays of documents
by calling `updateOne` and `deleteOne` for every item in the array. This is not
the best method of doing it, so stay tuned for improvements.

**Note 2:** Including credential in the connection uri, is a fairly common
practice with MongoDB. To tell Integreat that the source is authenticated and
make all built in security measures kick in, simply set `auth: true` on the
source def.

**Note 3:** As MongoDB does not allow keys with `.` in it or starting with `$`,
so these characters are mapped. `.` is always mapped to `\_`, and `$` is mapped
to `\$` when used at the beginning of a key. Consequently, `\` is mapped to
`\\` as well.

### Running the tests

The tests can be run with `npm test`.
