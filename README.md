[Integreat](https://github.com/integreat-io/integreat) use a MongoDB database
as source.

## Getting started

### Prerequisits

Requires node v8.6 and Integreat v0.6.

### Installing and using

Install from npm:

```
npm install integreat-adapter-mongodb
```

Example of use:
```javascript
const integreat = require('integreat')
const mongodb = require('integreat-adapter-mongodb')
const defs = require('./config')

const resources = mongodb(integreat.resources())
const great = integreat(defs, resources)

// ... and then dispatch actions as usual
```

The `mongodb()` function adds the adapter `mongodb` to the resources object, but
you still need to configure your source to use it.

Example source configuration:

```javascript
{
  id: 'store',
  adapter: 'mongodb',
  auth: true,
  baseUri: 'mongodb://username:password@mymongo.com',
  endpoints: [
    {options: {db: 'store', collection: 'documents'}}
  ]
}
```

The `baseUri` is used as the uri to the database.

An endpoint may have a `query` property, which should be an array of path
objects describing the query object used with MongoDB's `find()` method.

Here's an example:

```javascript
{
  ...
  endpoints: [
    {
      id: 'getDrafts',
      options: {
        db: 'store',
        collection: 'documents',
        query: [
          {path: 'type', param: 'type'},
          {path: 'attributes\\.status', value: 'draft'}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `path` property describes what property to set, and the property is set to
the value of `value` or to the value of the request parameter in `param`. Note
that dots in paths must be escaped here, as we are not setting the status
property on an attributes object, but rather setting the `attributes.status`
property.

The query object will look like this, for a request for items of type `entry`:
```javascript
{
  type: 'entry',
  'attributes.status': 'draft'
}
```

When the `pageSize` param is set in a request, it is taken as the max number of
documents to return in the response. When nothing else is specified, the first
page of documents is returned, and the `paging.next` prop on the response will
hold a params object that may be used to get the next page.

**Note 1:** This adapter is currently updating and deleting arrays of documents
by calling `updateOne` and `deleteOne` for every item in the array. This is not
the best method of doing it, so stay tuned for improvements.

**Note 2:** Including credential in the connection uri, is a fairly common
practice with MongoDB. To tell Integreat that the source is authenticated and
make all built in security measures kick in, simply set `auth: true` on the
source def.

### Running the tests

The tests can be run with `npm test`.
